<h1>Snake Game</h1>

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java. The game is played by controlling a snake as it moves around the game board, eating apples to grow longer while avoiding running into walls or the snake's own body.
<br>
<h1>Installation</h1>

To play the game, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from the official Java website. Once you have Java installed, you can run the game by compiling and running the SnakeGame.java file.
<br>
<h1>Controls</h1>

The game is controlled using the arrow keys or the WASD keys. Press the up arrow key or the W key to move the snake up, the down arrow key or the S key to move the snake down, the left arrow key or the A key to move the snake left, and the right arrow key or the D key to move the snake right.
<br>
<h1>Gameplay</h1>

The game starts with a snake that consists of a single block. The snake will move automatically in a straight line in the direction it is facing. The player can control the direction of the snake by using the arrow keys or the WASD keys. The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body.

When the snake eats an apple, it will grow longer by adding another block to its tail. The player can earn points by eating apples, and the game will get progressively harder as the snake gets longer and moves faster.

If the snake runs into a wall or its own body, the game is over and the player can choose to start a new game or quit.
